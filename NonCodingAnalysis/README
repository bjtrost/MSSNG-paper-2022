This folder contains scripts used to preprocess data and perform the burden analysis and transmission test of noncoding variants
Scripts in this folder are.
1. getDenovoFeatures.R - preprocess MSSNG de novo variants and transform the count into a matrix.
2. getDenovoFeaturesSSC.R - preprocess SSC de novo variants and transform the count into matrix.
3. denovo_test.R - perform multiple burden analyses including for both MSSNG and SSC cohorts.
4. getFeaturesSingletons.R - preprocess MSSNG private variants for transmission test.
5. getFeaturesSSCSingletons.R - preprocess SSC private variants for transmission test.
6. transformFeature_and_test_singletons.R - perform transmission test for MSSNG cohort.
7. transformFeatureSSC_and_test_singletons.R - perform transmission test for SSC cohort.
